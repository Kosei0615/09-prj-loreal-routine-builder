## How It Works

### Automatic Search Detection

The system automatically detects when users ask about:

### Search Keywords Detected:

```javascript

  "best",
  "top",
  "reviews",
  "price",
  "where to buy",
  "available",
  "launch",
  "ingredients",
  "research",
  "clinical";
```

### Example Queries That Trigger Search:

- "What are the latest L'Or√©al skincare products?"
- "Show me recent reviews for L'Or√©al serums"
- "What's trending in L'Or√©al makeup for 2025?"
- "Where can I buy L'Or√©al products?"

## Response Format
