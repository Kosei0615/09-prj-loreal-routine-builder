# Reflection Questions for L'Or√©al Routine Builder Project

## Prompt Writing

**Question**: How did you approach writing effective prompts for the OpenAI API to generate beauty routines? What strategies did you use to ensure the AI responses were relevant and helpful?

**Suggested Response Framework**:

- Describe how you structured the prompt to include product information
- Explain the importance of providing context about the user's selected products
- Discuss how you instructed the AI to focus on specific aspects (order, timing, benefits)
- Mention any prompt engineering techniques used (role-playing, specific instructions, examples)

## Overcoming Roadblocks

**Question**: What was the most challenging technical or design issue you encountered while building this project, and how did you solve it?

**Potential Challenges to Discuss**:

- Implementing product selection with visual feedback
- Managing state between selected products and localStorage
- Handling API integration securely with Cloudflare Workers
- Creating responsive design that works across devices
- Implementing the search and filter functionality
- Adding RTL language support
- Managing conversation history for follow-up questions

**Response Framework**:

- Identify the specific challenge
- Describe your problem-solving approach
- Explain the solution you implemented
- Reflect on what you learned from the experience

## LinkedIn Post

**Question**: Write a LinkedIn post showcasing your L'Or√©al Routine Builder project. Include key features, technologies used, and what you learned.

**Suggested Elements to Include**:
